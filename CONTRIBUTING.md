# MorningBot Contribution Guidelines

## Creating a PR
1. Fork the repo
2. Make your changes in master or other branch
3. Open a PR via the github UI
4. Write a concise title
5. Write a good description
6. Sit back and wait for review
7. Build upon constructive feedback and comments
8. Get it merged :)

## General PR Guidelines
- PRs need a title that gives maintainers an idea of the changes being made at a first glance
- Descriptions should explain what the pr is doing, why it's needed and how it's being done. Your PR won't be looked at if these criteria aren't met.
- Blast Radius: Each PR should address one problem only, if you want to do a full rewrite then fork it and do it on your own repo. Anything which spans multiple files must have a good reason behind it.
- Test coverage, if you are adding a feature, please include the proper test/CI if github actions is configured.

### Introductory/Minor PRs
